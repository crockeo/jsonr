# jsonr

`jsonr` is my first attempt at writing a proper C++ library. Its intent is to
make interfacing with JSON slightly easier. I understand that there are other
JSON parsing libraries out there (I've been told that
[jsoncpp](http://github.com/open-source-parsers) is great), but I wanted to
make my own.
